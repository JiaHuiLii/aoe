    [BLOCK] add @uptodate to end_that_request_last() and @error to rq_end_io_fn()
    
    add @uptodate argument to end_that_request_last() and @error
    to rq_end_io_fn().  there's no generic way to pass error code
    to request completion function, making generic error handling
    of non-fs request difficult (rq->errors is driver-specific and
    each driver uses it differently).  this patch adds @uptodate
    to end_that_request_last() and @error to rq_end_io_fn().
