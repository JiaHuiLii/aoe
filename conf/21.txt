Kernel 2.6.25 changed the way block devices appear in sysfs, and we
now must use "core devices" instead of raw disks.  See,

  commit edfaa7c36574f1bf09c65ad602412db9da5f96bf

... for details.

Then 2.6.28 made the "dev" member inaccessible, so we must use the new
disk_to_dev.

  commit ed9e1982347b36573cd622ee5f4e2a7ccd79b3fd

The three states are,

  gd

    Pre-2.6.25, with a pointer to gendisk passed to
    aoedisk_show_state.

  dev

    A struct device pointer is passed to aoedisk_show_state, and such
    a pointer is accessible via gd->dev.

    The gendisk struct doesn't have a kobj member.

  dtd	NEW

    The gd->dev member is inaccessible as of 2.6.28.
