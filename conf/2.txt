  The class_simple_... functions were removed from the kernel in
  2.6.13.

  We want aoechr.c to use class_simple if $(KDIR) has it, but not if
  it doesn't.

  We can't just grep for class_simple in
  $(KDIR)/include/linux/device.h because, e.g., Suse 9.3 Pro doesn't
  have device.h there.  The warnings from gcc, though, should
  consistently let us know whether the kernel sources have
  class_simple or not.
