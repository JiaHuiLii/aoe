v2.6.34-rc4 contains commit ee714f2dd33e, where Martin K. Petersen
removes a compatibility wrapper that equates blk_queue_max_sectors
with blk_queue_max_hw_sectors.

v2.6.34-rc1 contains commit 086fa5ff, where he renames
blk_queue_max_sectors to blk_queue_max_hw_sectors, to bring it in line
with a convention that applies to newer members of the block queue
limits, thus making it clear that the function updates max_hw_sectors.
