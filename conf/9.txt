FC2 has a 2.6.5 kernel that lacks a _count member in the page struct.
Instead, there is a count member.

akpm changed the member name to _count in 2.6.7 to keep people from
directly changing the member, but there are no macros to do what we
need to do when we sit between XFS, which gives us zero-ref pages in
bios, and the network layer, which uses get_page and put_page on pages
in frags.
