SLES 10, with its 2.6.16.60-0.54.5 kernel, doesn't have
skb_mac_header, so test 15 treats it as "old", but it has a
skb_reset_mac_header in skbuff.h, so it's an oddball.

This test accounts for that special case, but it's only relevant when
the aoe driver has been patched to include definitions for
skb_mac_header et al.  So 32-[ak]v.sh report "normal" if it hasn't
been patched.  This is one of those inter-test dependencies I like to
avoid.
