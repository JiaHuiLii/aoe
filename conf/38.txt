We are using compound_trans_head to find the page that holds the reference
count for a given page associated with a biovec.

The function first appears in a 2011 commit that is contained in the
v2.6.38-rc1~99 but has been backported to the RHEL 6 2.6.32 kernel.

      thp: add compound_trans_head() helper
      
      Cleanup some code with common compound_trans_head helper.
      
Before we were using this, older kernels didn't mind that we were
temporarily incrementing the reference count of tail pages, so for
compatibility we use a stub that simply returns whatever page it is
sent.
